### Iteration 3: Loops

  3.1 Print the characters of the driver's name, separated by space, and [in capital letters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase), i.e., `"J O H N"`.

  3.2 Print all the characters of the navigator's name in reverse order, i.e., `"nhoJ"`.

  3.3 Depending on the [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) of the strings, print: <br>

- `The driver's name goes first.` <br>
- `Yo, the navigator goes first, definitely.` <br>
- `What?! You both have the same name?`
